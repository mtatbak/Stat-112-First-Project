Overview

This project analyzes automobile sales data and explores global trends by integrating two datasets: auto-sales and world-data-2023. The project focuses on:

    Identifying relationships between sales and price.
    Analyzing average life expectancy in the top 10 GDP countries.
    Exploring car order patterns in European countries over time.
    Comparing average tax revenue and total tax rates across European countries.
    Understanding order statuses in European countries using heatmaps.

Datasets

    Auto-Sales Dataset: Contains 20 variables, including Order Number, Sales, and Price Each.
    World Data 2023 Dataset: Includes 14 variables, such as GDP, Life Expectancy, and Birth Rate.

Key Features

    Sales vs. Price Analysis:
        Used scatter plots to explore relationships between sales and price.
        Observed a positive linear relationship.

    Life Expectancy Analysis:

        Observed variations between countries, with Japan having the highest average life expectancy.

    European Car Orders Over Time:
        Used a slope chart to analyze rankings and patterns of car orders across European countries.

    Tax Analysis:
        Visualized average tax revenue and tax rates in Europe using dual-axis charts.

    Order Status Analysis:
        Heatmap visualization to analyze order statuses (Shipped, Cancelled, Resolved, etc.) by year for European countries.
